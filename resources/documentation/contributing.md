# Welcome Contributors! ðŸ‘‹
We â™¥ all contributors! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the OffBeets [code of conduct](https://github.com/MarleaM/OffBeets/blob/9d0b433f7105c1acc8a4cfa18a97d02ee1b6ca3d/resources/documentation/code-of-conduct.md).

If you're new here, here are some things you should know:
- A great introductory overview of the frontend and backend components of the application is available at the [frontend](https://github.com/MarleaM/OffBeets/blob/9d0b433f7105c1acc8a4cfa18a97d02ee1b6ca3d/resources/documentation/frontend_explanation.md) and [backend](https://github.com/MarleaM/OffBeets/blob/9d0b433f7105c1acc8a4cfa18a97d02ee1b6ca3d/resources/documentation/backend_explanation.md) guides
- Issues tagged "good first issue" are great for new contributors
- Pull Requests are manually reviewed by our four maintainers because our project is still in its early stages

# Communication ðŸ’¬
If you have any questions about an issue, please comment on the issue itself. Most of our communication will take place on GitHub, and our maintainers will be able to coordinate with you on issues and on pull requests. 

We appreciate all contributions and recognize the level of care and effort that goes into learning about our project and contributing. With that in mind, please do not be discouraged if your pull request is not immediately merged. At worst, you will likely only be required to make small changes.
